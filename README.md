# Domain-Finder
A Python script to find the official website URL for a given company name. It uses SearXNG for initial web searches and leverages an LLM (like Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, or Ollama) to analyze search results and identify the most likely official domain, filtering out common non-official links.
